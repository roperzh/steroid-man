# Steroid Man

*Man pages with steroids*

Steroid Man aims to be a real-time search engine for [man pages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

An online version of the application can be found [here](http://steroidman.herokuapp.com/).

### Why?

Well, it's just a proof of concept to learn more about:

 - Lotus.rb
 - Elasticsearch
 - Essential.js

### Roadmap

 - Keyboard navigation between search results
 - Add custom filters (by name, author, options, etc)
 - Improve the search accuracy
 - Add missing tests

### Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
